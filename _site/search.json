Welcome!\n\n\nNo-code interactive data visualization (Flourish)\n\nData viz is important.\nI think any scalable center will need highly interactive data viz that doesn’t require very high coding skills.\nPrecedent for Flourish: I took a look at their platform, and all their data visualization was done with Flourish, which is a service you actually told me about. There are now several precedents for using this platform for Climate research:\n\nLancet count down\nBoston University Center for Climate and Health.\n\nAs we are designing the integrated repository, I think it’s a good idea to invest in a no-code data viz.\nFlourish also has no-code Scrollies.\nWe could have workshops around no-code data visualization as a dissemination tool.\nSee: BU Workshop\n\nCCUH domain. I think it would be great to start talking about a CCUH domain name where we can attach online content that CCUH is generating, for example:\n\nDrexel Site core site:\n\nCurrent: Climate Center\nCould be: ccuh.org or drexel.ccuh.org\n\nInfrastructure documentation:\n\nCurrent: CCUH Data Infrastructure\nCould be: docs.ccuh.org\n\nDevelopers blog site:\n\nCould be: dev.cuuh.org\n\nIntegrated repository site:\n\nCould be: ccuh.org or portal.ccuh.org or repo.ccuh.org\n\nIntegrated repo infrastructure tests with WordPress as a Headless CMS\n\nHeadless CMS (Wordpress.com) - we should off load as much content management to PM as possible and giving them a tool like word press to control content is paramount - It is an established tech stack of wordpress as headless CMS and using next.js are a front end framework:\n\nhttps://codedamn.com/news\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxm6FNyKzwA\n\nFrontend (Next.js)\n\nwhat is the value fo a custom front end? we can control.\n\nData repository (Harvard Dataverse)\n\nThinking long term this is stable and easy to implement."
